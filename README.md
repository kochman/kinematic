# kinematic

Solves basic kinematic equations.

## Usage

`kinematic.py Dx=3 Vi=9.9 a=-9.8 t`

The above indicates that the change in position is known to be 3 meters, initial  velocity is 9.9 meters per second, and acceleration is -9.8 meters per second squared. The `t` at the end tells `kinematic` to solve for time.
